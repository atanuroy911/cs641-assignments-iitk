        You see the following written on the panel:

        23 96 15 32 27 65 66 98 15 58 1 59 107 39 8 54 78 27 70 53 48 90 70 101 126 118 124 26 96 64 61 88

        As you wonder what do these numbers mean, you hear a whisper in your ears ...
        "I am so happy that he went away without noticing me. He is the one who bound
        me to the hole. Oh, I was so scared that he will notice me!

        You must be wondering about these numbers. These are hash values of your password
        which is made of letters between 'f' and 'u'. Also, the letters in the password are
        in alphabetic order. For hashing, your password is viewed as a sequence
        of numbers x_1, x_2, ..., x_m in the field F_{127}. The ith number of the hashed
        sequence equals x_1^{i-1} + x_2^{i-1} + ... + x_m^{i-1}. As you can see, there are
        32 such numbers for i = 1 to 32."
